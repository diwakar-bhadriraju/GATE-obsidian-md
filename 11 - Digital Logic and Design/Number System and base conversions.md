# Base Conversions for Number System

Electronic and digital systems use various number systems such as Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal and Octal, which are essential in computing.
- Binary (base-2) is the foundation of digital systems.
- Hexadecimal (base-16) and Octal (base-8) are commonly used to simplify the representation of binary data.
- The Decimal system (base-10) is the standard system for everyday calculations.
- Other number systems, like Duodecimal (base-12), are less commonly used but have specific applications in certain fields.

## Number System Conversion Methods
A number N in base or radix b can be written as: 
> (N)b = dn-1 dn-2 -- -- -- -- d1 d0 . d-1 d-2 -- -- -- -- d-m
In the above, dn-1 to d0 is the integer part, then follows a radix point and then d-1 to d-m is the fractional part. 
dn-1 = Most significant bit (MSB) 
d-m = Least significant bit (LSB)

Base in Number System
### 1. Decimal to Binary Number System Conversion
**For Integer Part:**
- Divide the decimal number by 2.
- Record the remainder (0 or 1).
- Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until the quotient is 0.
- The binary equivalent is the remainders read from bottom to top.
**For Fractional Part:**
- Multiply the fractional part by 2.
- Record the integer part (0 or 1).
- Take the fractional part of the result and repeat the multiplication.
- Continue until the fractional part becomes 0 or reaches the desired precision.
- The binary equivalent is the integer parts recorded in sequence.
**Example:** (10.25)10 
![Base_Conversion_Example](assets/Base_Conversion_Example-ebedb47365.webp)
Decimal to Binary Conversion
**For Integer Part (10):**
- Divide 10 by 2 → Quotient = 5, Remainder = 0
- Divide 5 by 2 → Quotient = 2, Remainder = 1
- Divide 2 by 2 → Quotient = 1, Remainder = 0
- Divide 1 by 2 → Quotient = 0, Remainder = 1
Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives 1010.
**For Fractional Part (0.25):**
- Multiply 0.25 by 2 → Result = 0.5, Integer part = 0
- Multiply 0.5 by 2 → Result = 1.0, Integer part = 1
The fractional part ends here as the result is now 0. Reading from top to bottom gives 01.
Thus, the binary equivalent of (10.25)10 is (1010.01)2.
### 2. Binary to Decimal Number System Conversion
**For Integer Part:**
- Write down the binary number.
- Multiply each digit by 2 raised to the power of its position, starting from 0 (rightmost digit).
- Add up the results of these multiplications.
- The sum is the decimal equivalent of the binary integer.
**For Fractional Part:**
- Write down the binary fraction.
- Multiply each digit by 2 raised to the negative power of its position, starting from -1 (first digit after the decimal point).
- Add up the results of these multiplications.
- The sum is the decimal equivalent of the binary fraction.
**Example:** (1010.01)2 
> 1x23 + 0x22 + 1x21+ 0x20 + 0x2 -1 + 1x2 -2 = 8+0+2+0+0+0.25 = 10.25 
Thus, (1010.01)2 = (10.25)10 
### 3. Decimal to Octal Number System Conversion
**For Integer Part:**
- Divide the decimal number by 8.
- Record the remainder (0 to 7).
- Continue dividing the quotient by 8 until the quotient is 0.
- The octal equivalent is the remainders read from bottom to top.
**For Fractional Part:**
- Multiply the fractional part by 8.
- Record the integer part (0 to 7).
- Take the fractional part of the result and repeat the multiplication.
- Continue until the fractional part becomes 0 or reaches the desired precision.
- The octal equivalent is the integer parts recorded in sequence.
**Example:** (10.25)10 
**For Integer Part (10):**
- Divide 10 by 8 → Quotient = 1, Remainder = 2
- Divide 1 by 8 → Quotient = 0, Remainder = 1
Octal equivalent = 12 (write the remainder, read from bottom to top). So, the octal equivalent of the integer part 10 is 12.
**For Fractional Part (0.25):**
- Multiply 0.25 by 8 → Result = 2.0, Integer part = 2
The fractional part ends here as the result is now 0. So, the octal equivalent of the fractional part 0.25 is 0.2.
The octal equivalent of (10.25)10 = (12.2)8 
### 4. Octal to Decimal Number System Conversion
**For Integer Part:**
- Write down the octal number.
- Multiply each digit by 8 raised to the power of its position, starting from 0 (rightmost digit).
- Add up the results of these multiplications.
- The sum is the decimal equivalent of the octal integer.
**For Fractional Part:**
- Write down the octal fraction.
- Multiply each digit by 8 raised to the negative power of its position, starting from -1 (first digit after the decimal point).
- Add up the results of these multiplications.
- The sum is the decimal equivalent of the octal fraction.
**Example:** (12.2)8
> 1 x 81 + 2 x 80 +2 x 8-1 = 8+2+0.25 = 10.25 
Thus, (12.2)8 = (10.25)10 
### 5. Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion
**For Integer Part:**
- Divide the decimal number by 16.
- Record the remainder (0-9 or A-F).
- Continue dividing the quotient by 16 until the quotient is 0.
- The hexadecimal equivalent is the remainders read from bottom to top.
**For Fractional Part:**
- Multiply the fractional part by 16.
- Record the integer part (0-9 or A-F).
- Take the fractional part of the result and repeat the multiplication.
- Continue until the fractional part becomes 0 or reaches the desired precision.
- The hexadecimal equivalent is the integer parts recorded in sequence.
**Example:** (10.25)10
**Integer part:**
- 10 ÷ 16 = 0, Remainder = A (10 in decimal is A in hexadecimal)
Hexadecimal equivalent = A
**Fractional part:**
- 0.25 × 16 = 4, Integer part = 4
Hexadecimal equivalent = 0.4
Thus, (10.25)10 = (A.4)16
### 6. Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion
**For Integer Part:**
- Write down the hexadecimal number.
- Multiply each digit by 16 raised to the power of its position, starting from 0 (rightmost digit).
- Add up the results of these multiplications.
- The sum is the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal integer.
**For Fractional Part:**
- Write down the hexadecimal fraction.
- Multiply each digit by 16 raised to the negative power of its position, starting from -1 (first digit after the decimal point).
- Add up the results of these multiplications.
- The sum is the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal fraction.
Example: (A.4)16
> (A × 160) + (4 × 16-1) = (10 × 1) + (4 × 0.0625)
Thus, (A.4)16 = (10.25)10
### 7. Hexadecimal to Binary Number System Conversion
To convert from Hexadecimal to Binary:
- Each hexadecimal digit (0-9 and A-F) is represented by a 4-bit binary number.
![](assets/3-29-643e785519.jpg)
- For each digit in the hexadecimal number, find its corresponding 4-bit binary equivalent and write them down sequentially.
**Example:** (3A)16
- (3)16 = (0011)2
- (A)16 = (1010)2
Thus, (3A)16 = (00111010)2 
### 8. Binary to Hexadecimal Number System Conversion
To convert from [Binary to Hexadecimal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/how-to-convert-binary-to-hexadecimal/):
- Start from the rightmost bit and divide the binary number into groups of 4 bits each.
- If the number of bits isn't a multiple of 4, pad the leftmost group with leading zeros.
- Each 4-bit binary group corresponds to a single hexadecimal digit.
- Replace each 4-bit binary group with the corresponding hexadecimal digit.
**Example:** (1111011011)2
> 0011 1101 1011
>  | | |
>  3 D B
Thus, (001111011011 )2 = (3DB)16 
### 9. Binary to Octal Number System
To convert from binary to octal:
- Starting from the rightmost bit, divide the binary number into groups of 3 bits.
- If the number of bits is not a multiple of 3, add leading zeros to the leftmost group.
- Each 3-bit binary group corresponds to a single octal digit.
- The binary-to-octal conversion for each 3-bit group is as follows:
| Octal | Binary Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 000 |
| 1 | 001 |
| 2 | 010 |
| 3 | 011 |
| 4 | 100 |
| 5 | 101 |
| 6 | 110 |
| 7 | 111 |
- Replace each 3-bit binary group with the corresponding octal digit.
**Example:** (111101101)2
> 111 101 101
>  | | |
> 7 5 5
Thus, (111101101)2 = (755)8
### 10. Octal to Binary Number System Conversion
To convert from octal to binary:
- Each octal digit (0-7) corresponds to a 3-bit binary number.
- For each octal digit, replace it with its corresponding 3-bit binary equivalent.
**Example:** (153)8
- Break the octal number into digits: 1, 5, 3
- Convert each digit to binary:
  - 1 in octal = 001 in binary
  - 5 in octal = 101 in binary
  - 3 in octal = 011 in binary
Thus, (153)8 = (001101011)2
