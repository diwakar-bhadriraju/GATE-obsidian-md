# Concurrency Control in DBMS

In a Database Management System (DBMS), Concurrency control is a mechanism in DBMS that allows simultaneous execution of transactions while maintaining ACID properties - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability. It maintains the integrity, accuracy and reliability of data when multiple users or processes perform read/write operations concurrently. It helps manage issues like:
- Conflicting operations on shared data
- Inconsistent database states
- Lost or incorrect updates
> **Note:** By implementing concurrency control techniques such as locking or timestamp ordering, DBMS ensures that transactions are executed safely and independently, even when they overlap in time.
## Need of Concurrency Control
Concurrency control is essential to:

Concurrency Control
- Prevent conflicts between simultaneous transactions.
- Maintain data consistency and accuracy in multi-user environments.
- Avoid problems such as dirty reads, lost updates and inconsistent reads.
### Example:
- **Without concurrency control:** Two users update the same record simultaneously and one update overwrites the other.
- **With concurrency control:** The DBMS uses locks or timestamps to ensure updates occur sequentially and data remains correct.
## Concurrency Problems in DBMS
When multiple transactions execute concurrently, several problems may occur:
- **Dirty Read:** A transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction that may later roll back.
- **Lost Update:** Two transactions update the same data and one update overwrites the other.
- **Inconsistent Read:** A transaction reads the same data multiple times and the data changes in between reads.
## Concurrency Control Protocols
Concurrency control protocols define rules to ensure correct and consistent execution of transactions. The main protocols are:

Concurrency Control Protocols
### 1. Lock-Based Concurrency Control:
- Uses locks to restrict access to data items during a transaction. Common types include shared locks (read) and exclusive locks (write).
- Ensures serializability and prevents conflicts.
- **Example:** Two-Phase Locking (2PL) guarantees that once a transaction releases a lock, it cannot obtain any new locks.
### 2. Timestamp-Based Concurrency Control:
- Each transaction is assigned a timestamp.
- The DBMS uses these timestamps to order transactions and prevent conflicts based on their start time.

## Recoverable and Cascadeless Schedules
Concurrency control also ensures proper scheduling of transactions:
### Recoverable Schedules:
- A transaction commits only if all transactions it depends on have committed.
- Prevents inconsistencies caused by dependent transactions.
- **Example:** Strict 2PL ensures recoverability by delaying commits until all dependent transactions commit.
### Cascadeless Schedules:
- Avoids cascading rollbacks, where one failed transaction causes others to fail.
- Achieved by allowing transactions to read data only after the previous transaction commits.
## Advantages of Concurrency Control
1. **Reduced Waiting Time:** Multiple transactions can proceed simultaneously, reducing idle time.
2. **Improved Response Time:** Faster access and interaction with the database.
3. **Better Resource Utilization:** Hardware and database resources are efficiently shared.
4. **Increased System Efficiency:** Higher throughput and better overall performance.
## Disadvantages of Concurrency Control
1. **Overhead:** Managing locks and timestamps adds system overhead.
2. **Deadlocks:** Circular waits between transactions can halt progress.
3. **Reduced Concurrency:** Locking can limit the number of simultaneous transactions.
4. **Complexity:** Implementation in distributed or large systems can be difficult.
5. **Inconsistencies:** Rollbacks or long waits may cause temporary data inaccuracy or staleness.
