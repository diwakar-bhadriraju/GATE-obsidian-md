# Peterson's Algorithm in Process Synchronization

Peterson’s Algorithm is a classic software-based solution for the critical section problem in operating systems. It ensures mutual exclusion between two processes, meaning only one process can access a shared resource at a time, thus preventing race conditions.
The algorithm uses two shared variables:
- **flag[i]:** shows whether process i wants to enter the critical section.
- **turn:** indicates whose turn it is to enter if both processes want to access the critical section at the same time.
## The Algorithm
**For process Pi:**
> do {
>  flag[i] = true; // Pi wants to enter
>  turn = j; // Give turn to Pj
>
> while (flag[j] && turn == j); // Wait if Pj also wants to enter
>
> // Critical Section
>
> flag[i] = false; // Pi leaves critical section
>
> // Remainder Section
> } while (true);
**For process Pj:**
> do {
>  flag[j] = true;
>  turn = i;
>
> while (flag[i] && turn == i);
>
> // Critical Section
>
> flag[j] = false;
>
> // Remainder Section
> } while (true);
### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. **Intent to Enter:** A process sets its flag to true when it wants to enter the critical section.
2. **Turn Assignment:** It sets the turn variable to the other process, giving the other process the chance to enter first if it also wants to.
3. **Waiting Condition:** A process waits if the other process also wants to enter and it is the other’s turn.
4. **Critical Section:** Once the condition is false, the process enters the critical section safely.
5. **Exit:** On leaving, the process resets its flag to false, allowing the other process to proceed.
This guarantees:
- **Mutual Exclusion:** Only one process enters CS.
- **Progress:** A process will eventually enter CS if no other is inside.
- **Bounded Waiting;** No process waits indefinitely.
## Example Use Cases
Peterson’s Algorithm can be used (theoretically) in:
- **Accessing a shared printer**: Peterson's solution ensures that only one process can access the printer at a time when two processes are trying to print documents.
- **Reading and writing to a shared file**: It can be used when two processes need to read from and write to the same file, preventing concurrent access issues.
- **Competing for a shared resource**: When two processes are competing for a limited resource, such as a network connection or critical hardware, Peterson’s solution ensures mutual exclusion to avoid conflicts.
> **Note:** In practice, modern systems use hardware instructions or higher-level concurrency primitives.

### **Explanation of the above code:**
This program demonstrates Peterson’s Algorithm with two threads (P0 and P1).
- **flag[id]** **= true:** Process shows intent to enter the critical section.
- **turn = other:** Gives priority to the other process in case both want to enter.
- **while(flag[other] && turn == other):** If the other process also wants to enter and it’s their turn, wait.
- **Critical Section:** Only one process enters at a time.
- **flag[id] = false:** On exit, process resets its intent, allowing the other to enter.
