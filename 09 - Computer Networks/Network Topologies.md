# Types of Network Topology

Network topology is the arrangement of devices (nodes) and connections (links) in a computer network. It shows how computers, servers, and other devices are connected and how data flows between them. Choosing the right topology is important because it affects the performance, cost, reliability, and security of the network. There are two main types of topology:
- **Physical Topology:** The actual physical layout of cables and devices.
- **Logical Topology:** How data moves across the network, regardless of physical layout.
All the following topologies (Bus, Star, Mesh, Ring, Tree, Hybrid) are physical topologies. Logical topology refers to how data flows in the network, such as CSMA/CD in Ethernet or token passing in ring networks.
## Point To Point Topology
Point-to-point topology is a type of topology that works on the functionality of the sender and receiver. It is the simplest communication between two nodes, in which one is the sender and the other one is the receiver. Point-to-Point provides high bandwidth.

Point to Point Topology
### Advantages
- Simple and easy to set up
- High data transfer speed (dedicated link)
- Secure communication (direct connection)
- Low chances of data collision
### Disadvantages
- Not suitable for large networks
- Expensive if many devices need connection
- Limited scalability
- Failure of link disconnects communication
## Mesh Topology
In a mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via a particular channel. Every device is connected to another via dedicated channels. These channels are known as links. Mesh topology does not depend on specific protocols; it focuses on direct device-to-device connections.
![mesh_topology](assets/mesh_topology-a533b2f71d.webp)
Mesh
- Suppose, the N number of devices are connected with each other in a mesh topology, the total number of ports that are required by each device is
$$
N-1
$$
  . In Figure , there are 6 devices connected to each other, hence the total number of ports required by each device is 5. The total number of ports required
$$
\text{= N * (N-1)}
$$
  .
- Suppose, N number of devices are connected with each other in a mesh topology, then the total number of dedicated links required to connect them is
$$
^NC_2
$$
   i.e.
$$
\text{N * (N-1)/2}
$$
  . In Figure, there are 6 devices connected to each other, hence the total number of links required is
$$
\text{6 * 5/2 = 15}
$$
  .
### Advantages
- Communication is very fast between the nodes.
- Mesh Topology is robust.
- The fault is diagnosed easily. Data is reliable because data is transferred among the devices through dedicated channels or links.
- Provides security and privacy.
### Disadvantages
- Installation and configuration are difficult.
- The cost of cables is high as bulk wiring is required, hence suitable for less number of devices.
- The cost of maintenance is high.
> **Note:** A common example of mesh topology is the internet backbone, where various internet service providers are connected to each other via dedicated channels. This topology is also used in military communication systems and aircraft navigation systems.
## Star Topology
In Star Topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node. The hub can be passive in nature i.e., not an intelligent hub such as broadcasting devices, at the same time the hub can be intelligent known as an active hub. Active hubs have repeaters in them.

S tar Topology
> **Note:** Here, Coaxial cables or RJ-45 cables are used to connect the computers & many popular  [Ethernet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-ethernet/)  LAN protocols are used as CD(Collision Detection),  [CSMA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/carrier-sense-multiple-access-csma/)  (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), etc.
### Advantages
- If N devices are connected to each other in a star topology, then the number of cables required to connect them is N. So, it is easy to set up.
- Each device requires only 1 port i.e. to connect to the hub, therefore the total number of ports required is N.
- It is Robust. If one link fails only that link will affect and not other than that.
- Easy to fault identification and fault isolation.
- Star topology is cost-effective as it uses inexpensive coaxial cable.
### Disadvantages
- If the concentrator (hub) on which the whole topology relies fails, the whole system will crash down.
- The cost of installation is high.
- Performance is based on the single concentrator i.e. hub.
> **Note:** A common example of star topology is a local area network (LAN) in an office where all computers are connected to a central hub. This topology is also used in wireless networks where all devices are connected to a wireless access point.
## Bus Topology
Bus Topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable. It is bi-directional. It is a multi-point connection and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes. IBus-topology Ethernet uses only the CSMA/CD MAC protocol. TDMA, CDMA, Pure ALOHA, and Slotted ALOHA were never used in Ethernet.

Bus Topology
### Advantages
- If N devices are connected to each other in a bus topology, then the number of cables required to connect them is 1, known as backbone cable, and N drop lines are required.
- Coaxial or twisted pair cables are mainly used in bus-based networks that support up to 10 Mbps.
- The cost of the cable is less compared to other topologies, but it is used to build small networks.
- Bus topology is familiar technology as installation and troubleshooting techniques are well known.
- CSMA/CD was the only MAC method used in traditional bus Ethernet. Modern switched Ethernet does not use CSMA/CD because full-duplex operation eliminates collisions.
### Disadvantages
- A bus topology is quite simpler, but still, it requires a lot of cabling.
- If the common cable fails, then the whole system will crash down.
- If the network traffic is heavy, it increases collisions in the network. To avoid this, various protocols are used in the MAC layer known as Pure Aloha, Slotted Aloha, CSMA/CD, etc.
- Adding new devices to the network would slow down networks.
- Security is very low.
> **Note:** A common example of bus topology is the Ethernet LAN, where all devices are connected to a single coaxial cable or twisted pair cable. This topology is also used in cable television networks.
## Ring Topology
In a Ring Topology, it forms a ring connecting devices with exactly two neighboring devices. A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes, because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network.
![ring_topology_](assets/ring_topology_-5b4ac6c6ce.webp)
Ring Topology
> **Note:** Here, data flows in one direction, but it can be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each Network Node, it is called Dual Ring Topology.
### Operations
- One station is known as a monitor station which takes all the responsibility for performing the operations.
- To transmit the data, the station has to hold the token. After the transmission is done, the token is to be released for other stations to use.
- When no station is transmitting the data, then the token will circulate in the ring.
### Advantages
- The data transmission is high-speed.
- The possibility of collision is minimum in this type of topology.
- Cheap to install and expand.
### Disadvantages
- The failure of a single node in the network can cause the entire network to fail.
- Troubleshooting is difficult in this topology.
- Less secure.
## Tree Topology
Tree topology is the variation of the Star topology. This topology has a hierarchical flow of data. In Tree Topology, protocols like [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/) and SAC (Standard Automatic Configuration) are used.
- Here, various secondary hubs are connected to the central hub which contains the repeater.
- This data flow from top to bottom i.e. from the central hub to the secondary and then to the devices or from bottom to top i.e. devices to the secondary hub and then to the central hub.
- It is a [multi-point connection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/differences-between-point-to-point-and-multi-point-communication/) and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes.
![tree_topology](assets/tree_topology-442c83548e.webp)
Tree Toplogy
### Advantages
- It allows more devices to be attached to a single central hub thus it decreases the distance that is traveled by the signal to come to the devices.
- It allows the network to get isolated and also prioritize from different computers.
- We can add new devices to the existing network.
### Disadvantages
- If the central hub gets fails the entire system fails.
- The cost is high because of the cabling.
- If new devices are added, it becomes difficult to reconfigure.
> **Note:** A common example of a tree topology is the hierarchy in a large organization. CEO is the root, who is connected to the different departments(child nodes) of the company, managers overseeing different teams (grandchild nodes) & team members (leaf nodes) are at the bottom of the hierarchy.
## Hybrid Topology
Hybrid Topology is the combination of all the various types of topologies we have studied above. Hybrid Topology is used when the nodes are free to take any form. It means these can be individuals such as Ring or Star topology or can be a combination of various types of topologies seen above. Each individual topology uses the protocol that has been discussed earlier.

Hybrid Topology
### Advantages
- This topology is very flexible.
- The size of the network can be easily expanded by adding new devices.
### Disadvantages
- It is challenging to design the architecture of the Hybrid Network.
- Hubs used in this topology are very expensive.
- The infrastructure cost is very high as a hybrid network requires a lot of cabling and network devices .
> **Note:** A common example of a hybrid topology is a university campus network. The network may have a backbone of a star topology, with each building connected to the backbone through a switch or router. Within each building, there may be a bus or ring topology connecting the different rooms and offices.
### Important Points
Network Topology is important because it defines how devices are connected and how they communicate in the network. Here are some points that defines why network topology is important.
- **Network Performance:** Upon choosing the appropriate topology as per requirement, it helps in running the network easily and hence increases network performance.
- **Network Reliability:** Some topologies like Star, Mesh are reliable as if one connection fails, they provide an alternative for that connection, hence it works as a backup.
- **Network Expansion** : Choosing correct topology helps in easier expansion of Network as it helps in adding more devices to the network without disrupting the actual network.
- **Network Security:** Network Topology helps in understanding how devices are connected and hence provides a better security to the network.
